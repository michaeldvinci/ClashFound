Swift iOS application with companion watchOS app used to store offline schedules generated from your favorite Clashfinder!

Roadmap:
* Implement Config
* Implement NSUSerData
* Implement reading saved Clashfinders... It can parse the link, but the html will be from the link not including any params after /?
